Project Showcase: Chess AI using Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning

A Chess AI built from scratch using Minimax Algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning optimization.

What it does:

 This project simulates a full chess game with an AI opponent that makes intelligent decisions based on future move prediction and evaluation.

Key Features:

Interactive GUI built using Pygame

AI opponent using Minimax Algorithm

Optimized performance with Alpha-Beta Pruning

Real-time move generation, board updates, and game over detection

Tech Stack:

Python

Pygame for GUI

Minimax Tree with depth control

Alpha-Beta pruning for performance

This project challenged my logic-building, recursion optimization, and game development skills. Looking forward to adding more features like move history, undo, difficulty levels, and maybe even training a model for dynamic move prediction!
